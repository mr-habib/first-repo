# My first repository

My favourite super power is super speed because, well, there are a couple reasons. The first reason is that the Flash can travel faster than the speed of light (hence time travel), meaning that he theoretically can produce an INFINITE force (e = mc^2, if his speed is > c, then e is infinite). Also, getting places super fast would be cool. Also the Flash is my favourite super hero.
